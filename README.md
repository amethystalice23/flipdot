# flipdot
Code, docs and drivers for the Swansea Hackspace flipdot project.

## The project
A member of Swansea Hackspace has got a hold of a bunch of old flip-dot
display boards that used to be on a bus.

With only one functional driver unit, and no manuals, we have set about
trying to reverse engineer them, and turn them into functional displays.

[The Project So Far](http://swansea.hackspace.org.uk/Main/Projects)

This repository serves to hold some of the more fluid items like Code
to drive the boards, protocol descriptions, and so on.
